# Cobblemon Remove Base Game Spawns

A python file I used to make https://modrinth.com/datapack/cobblemon-remove-base-game-spawns

Some brief instructions of how to use it:

Make a directory and add the spawn files of all pokemon that you want to remove (in my case from the cobblemon .jar file)
Link that directory in the path variable in the python file
Run the python file and the .json files will generate in the same directory as the python file
Add the .json files into data\cobblemon\spawn_pool_world in the data pack
